            Efficient exploration is essential for intelligent systems interacting with their environment, but 
            existing language models often fall short in scenarios that require strategic information gathering. 
            In this paper, we present <b>PAPRIKA</b>, a fine-tuning approach that enables language models to develop general 
            decision-making capabilities that are not confined to particular environments. By training on synthetic 
            interaction data from different tasks that require diverse strategies, <b>PAPRIKA</b> teaches models to explore and 
            adapt their behavior on a new task based on environment feedback in-context without more gradient updates. 
            Experimental results show that models fine-tuned with <b>PAPRIKA</b> can effectively transfer their learned 
            decision-making capabilities to entirely unseen tasks without additional training. Unlike traditional training, 
            our approach's primary bottleneck lies in sampling useful interaction data instead of model updates. 
            To improve sample efficiency, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that prioritizes sampling trajectories 
            from tasks with high learning potential. These results suggest a promising path towards AI systems that can 
            autonomously solve novel sequential decision-making problems that require interactions with the external world.

        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            The goal of our paper is to develop a scalable method to instill better strategic exploration and sequential decision-making capabilities into LLMs. 
            Prior works (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07064">Krishnamurthy et al., 2024</a>) have shown that LLMs can perform poorly on even the simple decision making task of multi-armed bandits. 
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06238">Nie et al., 2024</a> has since then demonstrated that LLMs can be taught to perform better on bandits after fine-tuning them on synthetic trajectories 
            generated by known algorithms such as UCB. However, this idea is limited in scope for three reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>(1)</b> We want LLMs to perform strategic exploration and decision making in more complex settings</li>
            <li><b>(2)</b> For most tasks, there is no known algorithm like UCB to generate good synthetic trajectories from</li>
            <li><b>(3)</b> It can be infeasible to collect data for all tasks that we care about</li>

        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          PAPRIKA aims to solve the above problems. First, we design a suite of complex decision-making tasks that require strategic information gathering to succeed. Next, we show that in the absence of known good algorithms, existing LLMs can generate trajectories with better decision making behaviors through diversity-encouraging sampling. We then finetune the LLMs to prefer higher performing trajectories (in a fashion similar to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14465">STaR</a>) and show that this leads to better decision making abilities at test-time. More importantly, <b>these behaviors often generalize to unseen task groups without additional training</b>. Finally, we propose a general curriculum learning algorithm that can dynamically choose which subset of tasks to train on next to improve data efficiency of such training methods. We next describe each component of PAPRIKA.

        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <!-- Create Bullet Point List to Summarize -->
          To both evaluate and then train LLMs, we design 10 diverse textual task groups, each of which comprises of partially observable tasks that require multiturn interaction with the task environment, strategic exploration and good sequential decision making abilities for an agent to succeed at them. Below is a summary of these task groups.
        </div>

            class="paprika_task_groups"/>
        </center>

        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          We generate 20 samples per each task in the training split, then collected all the successful trajectories to form our supervised fine-tuning dataset. Next, we took the best trajectory per task (successful and achieved success with the fewest number of turns) and one of the lower scoring trajectories (unsuccessful or successful but with a significantly more number of turns) to form a preference pair. Ultimately, we end up with 17,181 SFT trajectories and 5260 trajectory preference pairs.

        <h3 class="title is-4">Optimization</h3>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <!-- Create Bullet Point List to Summarize -->
          We use a multiturn variant of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290">DPO</a>) to fine-tune our models, where log probabilities are calculated autoregressively over the entire trajectory, but then
          only the log probabilities of the agent generated tokens are considered for calculating the training loss. In practice, we first run supervised finetuning, and then use the sum of SFT and DPO (similar to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19733">RPO</a>) losses to optimize our LLMs.

        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          PAPRIKA's primary bottleneck lies in generating training trajectories, rather than model updates. So it is crucial that we generate more rollouts on tasks that have high learning potential. 
        </div>

        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          However, it is hard to know which tasks would have high learning potential without generating rollouts first. To make progress, we make the additional assumption that similar tasks have similar learning potential, and that we have task similarity groups over our set of all tasks. Next, we use the coefficient of variation as a metric for measuring learning potential. Given a task group, we can sample one task from it, generate multiple trajectories for this task to calculate the coefficient of variation (COV) (over number of turns, which we use as a proxy for reward). We can then use this task COV to update our estimate of the task group's COV distribution, which can tell us which task group to sample from next if we want to maximize the COV of our sampled tasks.

        <h3 class="title is-4">PAPRIKA can teach LLMs strategies that generalize zero-shot to a new task group</h3>

        The next important question we study is whether the strategies learned by PAPRIKA can zero-shot transfer to entirely different groups of tasks. To do so, we perform a set of leave-one-out (LOO) experiments: we randomly choose one group (e.g., 20 questions) from our set of environments, train the LLM on trajectories generated from every other group, and test the resulting model's performance on the left-out group. Our results show that PAPRIKA (LOO) outperforms the starting model, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, in 6 representative task groups. This shows that the strategic exploration taught by PAPRIKA is not tied to a particular environment, and <b>scaling up the number of task groups in PAPRIKA can be a viable solution for teaching LLMs general in-context RL abilities</b>.

              <b>(Qualitative analysis of behaviors taught by PAPRIKA)</b> PAPRIKA not only improves over the starting model in terms of success rate and other metrics, but also shows better sequential decision making abilities. Here we present two example trajectories on 20 questions, where the hidden topic the agent has to guess is a <b>concept</b>, and the correct answer is <b>primary numbers</b>. The PAPRIKA fine-tuned model asks much better quality questions and is able to guess the topic in 8 turns, whereas the regular instruct model cannot guess it after spending all 20 turns, in all 4 attempts that we ran (we only show first 9 turns for the sake of brevity).
